<h3>Finding a suitable job in a huge amount of data is a too exhausting activity. Sometimes the jobs' list in a site is not trustable, I mean many jobs have been repeated more than one times, and you should cope with the duplicate information.

<h2> Code Description
<h4> Many techniques have been used in this code such as:

- Web Scrape
  - BeautifulSoup
- Data Scientist
  - NLP (NLTK)
    - TFIDF
    - Word Tokenize
  - KMeans
  
<h2> Considerations
  
 <h4> To run this code you should have your TEXT (.txt) English CV as a TEXT file. To more effective results the translated CV in different languages like Germany and French are needed to correlate the CV with all available positions in different languages. This CV should include the most important word keys.
