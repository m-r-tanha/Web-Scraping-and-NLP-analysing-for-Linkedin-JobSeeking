<h3>Finding a suitable job in a huge amount of data is a too exhausting activity. Sometimes the jobs' list in a site is not trustable, I mean many jobs have been repeated more than one time, and you should cope with the duplicate information. For example fo a Job title in a specific location the Linkedin result was 189, but after analyzing the data, the 47 unique jobs have been extracted.

<h2> Code Description:
<h4> Many techniques have been used in this code such as:

- Web Scrape
  - BeautifulSoup
- Data Scientist
  - NLP (NLTK)
    - TFIDF
    - Word Tokenize
  - KMeans
  
<h2> Considerations:
<h4>  To run the Python code the below procedures should be considered: 
  
- To run this code you should have your TEXT (.txt) English CV as a TEXT file. To more effective results the translated CV in different languages like Germany and French are needed to correlate the CV with all available positions in different languages. This CV should include the most important word keys.
- At first you should search your job with its cretria in Linkedin site as part 2 in below figure.
- The address will be asked in code, so it should be copied
